The primary focus of this project is to study the possibility of automatizing the web design process by interpreting and rendering hand-drawn sketches to html code. This, therefore, enables someone with limited to no knowledge of html to be able to draw and create a web page. The end product is a functioning and interactable user interface programmed in Java that takes drawings as user input and returns a “simple beautified” preview of the drawing as a web page as well as the corresponding HTML code as a html file.
